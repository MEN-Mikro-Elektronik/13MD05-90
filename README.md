# 13MD05-90 - MDIS5 System Package for Linux

This is the base repository of the MDIS5 System Package for Linux. It includes some other repositories as submodules.
The 13MD05-90 MDIS5 system package includes most standard device drivers for Linux available from MEN.

MDIS, the MEN Driver Interface System, is a framework to develop device drivers for almost any kind of I/O hardware. A properly written driver runs on all operating systems supported by MDIS. Operating systems currently supported include Linux, Windows, VxWorks and QNX (MDIS4 only).

## Supported Components

For detailed information about supported Linux versions and hardware components of the current release, please refer to *supported_components.md* of this repository.

## Official Release and Documentation

For the latest official released version, please visit the MEN website https://www.men.de/software/13md05-90

The 13MD05-90 MDIS5 system package contains the *QUICKSTART.md* Quick Start Guide. You can use it as a cheat sheet to set up MDIS for Linux, but it doesn't provide any background information on MDIS. For comprehensive information, please refer to the MDIS User Manual for Linux (*21md05-90.pdf*).
