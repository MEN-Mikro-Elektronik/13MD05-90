  R: 1. scan_system generated SMB descriptor on F21P didnt work
     2. customers could not find conductive cooled variants of CPUs
     3. repeating system scan in same folder caused load errors in wizard

-----[ Revision 1.9 ]-----
[ 2013-01-18 16:14:12 by ts ]
R: 1. separate driver selection is sometimes difficult, necessary drivers are not clear
   2. F223 not yet selectable in MDIS wizard 
   3. configuring systems like SC24 manually is difficult, causing effort for support
   4. on different distros SMBus numbers differ, making SMB2 driver config difficult
M: 1. integrated most used MDIS LL & native drivers to package
   2. added F223 to MDIS wizard, updated wizard version to 10.3
   3. added scanning for automatic MDIS configuration on standard systems
   4. added function to scan for correct SMBus number in scan script

Known issues:
reopening SC24 configs fails due to unknown model "SC24_FPGA", fixed in next release
scan of IO mapped chameleon FPGAs not yet possible, fixed in next release

----- started maintenance in bazaar -----

-----[ Revision 1.8 ]-----
[ 2012-08-08 20:35:25 by ts ]
R: 1. Mapping of SC24 FPGA into LPC space required pciset commands on init
   2. SC24: FPGA IRQ is connected to ISA edge type IRQ, needs level type
   3. SC24: IOAPIC address might vary depending on the linux distro
   4. SC24: future distros might use different IOAPIC setup
   5. New Box Computer models were not shown in MDIS wizard
M: 1. added automatic PCI config accesses to map FPGA if SC24 is selected
   2. added IRQ type adjustment for chameleon FPGA if SC24 is selected

   2b) Only build chameleon io library variant if x86 architecture AND
       chameleon lib is selected by user

       distributions)
