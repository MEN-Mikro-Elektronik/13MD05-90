PLD Loader API
--------------
Each PLD loader contains of two functions:

	PLD_XXX_Identify   - Return loader identify string
                         Format: "PLD - XXX Loader: $Id: general.txt,v 1.1 1998/10/12 09:35:07 see Exp $"
                         (auto-created from RCS)

    PLD_XXX_LoadCallBk - Loading XXX with binary data (callback i/o) 
                         This function is for complicated PLD interfaces,
                         where PLD bits are located in different registers.

    PLD_XXX_LoadDirect - Loading XXX with binary data (direct access) 
                         This function is for simple PLD interfaces,
                         where all PLD bits are located in one register.

PLD data can be loaded at once or blockwise depending on
passed 'flags':

    PLD_FIRSTBLOCK  = perform PLD initialization before loading
    PLD_LASTBLOCK   = perform PLD termination after loading

a) load data at once
- load full block with flags=PLD_FIRSTBLOCK+PLD_LASTBLOCK

b) load data blockwise
- load first block with flags=PLD_FIRSTBLOCK
- load n-blocks    with flags=0
- load last block  with flags=PLD_LASTBLOCK
       
The PLD data array passed to the loader function 
must contain the PLD data as raw byte stream.
