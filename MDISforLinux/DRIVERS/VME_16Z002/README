VME4L README File
-----------------

VME4L is a kernel mode driver that allows userland applications and kernel
mode drivers to access the VMEbus, handle interrupts and make use of
other VME bridge functions.


Installation
-------------

This driver is meant to be built as part of an MEN MDIS project. See MDIS user manual 21MD05-90 for details,
can be downloaded at www.men.de

Supported Kernel Releases
-------------------------

VME4L currently has been tested under Linux 3.4.18 to 4.4.24. Kernel 2.4 is no longer supported.


Compatibility to Previous VME4L Version
---------------------------------------

On PowerPC, this release of VME4L is source and binary compatible to the
previous vme-menpci2vme driver, although the old userland interface is
no longer documented and no longer recommended.

The current release has been rewritten from scratch and has a new userland
API, using the libvme4l_api.so (.a) library.


License
-------

All source files of the VME4L driver are released under the GNU GPL v2 or later,
see license comment in source code.

Known Problems
--------------

- Rev <=7 of PLDZ002 does not support DMA into main memory.  Therefore
  an intermediate buffer (top 256K of the PLD's shared RAM) is
  used. This slows down DMA transfers to approx.  5 MB/s.
